This should be a README to fork a new repo kjbible_lowres.
ABOUT Access_copies_small-tiffs.924b4a964fffe2c8eb25d7b8cc988bd3.zip These were downloaded from Universitybof Pennsylvania library they are purported to be the sources of the images displayes in the library viewer of the 1611 KJV bible. Alongside this download are the full resolution original scans at over 21GB [SIZE_HERE]. These presumably have been created by UPenn reason of bandwidth limitations when transferring to the reader for the most part these should be ignored because the high resolution is availiable. I only keep these as a factor in determining any unforeseen corruption. The full res is really the more important and these access copies may be ignored for the most part. Because this is over 2G it is not uploaded to GitHub here which has a maximum filesize limit. Maybe these can be uploaded aftet unpacked zip.
 20241111 These have been uploaded with checksums included. To be forked into freedom-foundation/kjbible_lowres and stored away.

# 1611_King_James_Bible
The purpose of this 1611_King_James_Bible repository is to store the downloaded checksummed and signed purported sources of the 1611 King James Bible. And this to support the requirements of [freePressâ„¢](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/freePress).
 Forthcomming this repository is a [Bible Quest](https://github.com/users/freedom-foundation/projects/6) project to visit the upstream source at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Pennsylvania in which it is held and verify the hardcopy source.

I welcome a second attestation of the checksums of my download. The checksums of the content of the download are in this repository for the Access_copies here https://github.com/freedom-foundation/1611_King_James_Bible/blob/main/Access%20copies%20(small%20tiffs)/MD5SUMS .
 The Access copies are to be sidelined but can serve as a second checksum in the case the preservation_copies are corrupted.
20241112 - Q. How to create a new GutHub repository (kjbible_lowres) from the subdirectory of an existing GitHub repository ( 1611 )?
A. Don't.
 A quick search shows users having problems ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6680709/create-new-git-repo-from-already-existing-repos-subdirectory ) a good sign not to try it. It would be asking for trouble. 
 Official Docs here ( https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository ) show that it basicly needs to be cloned and re-uploaded. Maybe come back and do this later. Although this would make a good GitHub
 Feature Request: GitHub fork's existing repos instantly there could be a way to fork a subdir as a new repo. 
 Because it looks like asking for trouble I will create a new repos for the Bible kjbible and leave kjbible_lowres here.

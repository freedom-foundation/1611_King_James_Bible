# 1611_King_James_Bible
The purpose of this 1611_King_James_Bible repository is to store the downloaded checksummed and signed purported sources of the 1611 King James Bible. And this to support the requirements of [freePressâ„¢](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/freePress).
 Forthcomming this repository is a [Bible Quest](https://github.com/users/freedom-foundation/projects/6) project to visit the upstream source at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Pennsylvania in which it is held and verify the hardcopy source.

I welcome a second attestation of the checksums of my download. The checksums of the content of the download are in this repository for the Access_copies here https://github.com/freedom-foundation/1611_King_James_Bible/blob/main/Access%20copies%20(small%20tiffs)/MD5SUMS .
 The Access copies are to be sidelined but can serve as a second checksum in the case the preservation_copies are corrupted.
